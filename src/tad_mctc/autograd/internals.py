PyTorch AD functions
====================

This module imports PyTorch's own autograd functions, depending on the version.

Important! Before PyTorch 2.0.0, `functorch` does not work together with custom
autograd functions, which we definitely require. Additionally, `functorch`
imposes the implementation of a `forward` **and** `setup_context` method, i.e.,
the traditional way of using `forward` with the `ctx` argument does not work.

import torch

__all__ = ["jacrev"]


if torch.__version__ < (2, 0, 0):  # type: ignore[import-error]
    try:
        from functorch import jacrev  # type: ignore[import-error]
    except ModuleNotFoundError:
        jacrev = None
else:
    from torch.func import jacrev  # type: ignore[import-error]
