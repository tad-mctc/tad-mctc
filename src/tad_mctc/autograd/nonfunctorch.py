Autograd Utility: Loop-based Jacobian
=====================================

These derivative functions do not use `functorch`, but construct the Jacobian
row-by-row. This is slower than using `functorch`.

    Compute the Jacobian of ``a`` with respect to ``b`` row-by-row.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : Tensor
        Variable that is differentiated.
    b : Tensor
        Variable with respect to which the derivative is taken.
    create_graph : bool | None, optional
        Whether to create a backprogatable graph. Required for additional
        (higher) derivatives. Defaults to ``True``.
    retain_graph : bool, optional
        Whether to use the multiple graph multiple times. Defaults to ``True``.
        Otherwise, the graph is deleted after the first call.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Jacobian of ``a`` with respect to ``b``.
