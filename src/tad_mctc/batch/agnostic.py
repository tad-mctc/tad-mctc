non-batched tensors out of the box.

    Create an identity tensor. This version handles a possible batch

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : Tensor
        Tensor shape to create the identity tensor from.
    value : float, optional
        Value to fill the diagonal with. Defaults to `1.0`.
    device : :class:`torch.device` | None, optional
        Device to create the tensor on. If `None`, the device of the input
    dtype : :class:`torch.dtype` | None, optional
        Data type of the tensor. If `None`, the data type of the input.

    -------
    Tensor
        Possibly batched identity tensor.
