    Pad a list of variable length tensors with zeros, or some other value, and
    pack them into a single tensor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensors : list[Tensor] | tuple[Tensor] | Tensor
        List of tensors to be packed, all with identical dtypes.
    axis : int
        Axis along which tensors should be packed; 0 for first axis -1
        for the last axis, etc. This will be a new dimension.
    value : int | float
        The value with which the tensor is to be padded.
    size :
        Size of each dimension to which tensors should be padded.
        This to the largest size encountered along each dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    padded : Tensor
        Input tensors padded and packed into a single tensor.
