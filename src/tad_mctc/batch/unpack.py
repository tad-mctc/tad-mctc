Batch Utility: Unpacking

Functions for unpacking packed tensors and removal of padding.

def deflate(
    tensor: Tensor, value: int | float | bool = 0, axis: int | None = None
) -> Tensor:
    """
    Remove extraneous, trailing padding values from a tensor.

    Shrinks the given tensor by removing superfluous trailing padding values.
    All axes are deflated by default, but a specific axis can be exempted from
    deflation using the `axis` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : Tensor
        The tensor to be deflated.
    value : int | float | bool, optional
        The identity of the padding value, by default 0.
    axis : int or None, optional
        The axis which is exempt from deflation, by default None.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        The deflated tensor.

    Notes
    -----
    Only trailing padding values are removed; columns are only removed from
    the end of a matrix, not the start or middle. Deflation is not performed
    on one-dimensional systems when `axis` is not None.

    Examples
    --------
    Remove unnecessary padding from a batch:

    >>> over_packed = torch.tensor([
    >>>     [0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    >>>     [3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 0],
    >>> ])
    >>> deflate(over_packed, value=0, axis=0)
    tensor([[0, 1, 2, 0],
            [3, 4, 5, 6]])

    Remove padding from a system once part of a batch:

    >>> packed = torch.tensor([
    >>>     [0, 1, 0, 0],
    >>>     [3, 4, 0, 0],
    >>>     [0, 0, 0, 0],
    >>>     [0, 0, 0, 0]])
    >>> deflate(packed, value=0)
    tensor([[0, 1],
            [3, 4]])

    Warnings
    --------
    Real elements may be misidentified as padding values if they match the
    padding value. Choose an appropriate padding value to mitigate this risk.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `tensor` is 0-dimensional or 1-dimensional when `axis` is not None.

def unpack(
    tensor: Tensor, value: int | float | bool = 0, axis: int = 0
) -> tuple[Tensor, ...]:
    """
    Unpacks packed tensors into their constituents and removes padding.

    This function acts as the inverse of the `pack` operation. It splits a
    packed tensor along a specified axis and removes any padding that was added
    during packing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : Tensor
        The tensor to be unpacked.
    value : int | float | bool, optional
        The identity of the padding value, by default 0.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the tensor was packed, by default 0.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[Tensor, ...]
        A tuple of the constituent tensors after unpacking and deflating.

    Examples
    --------
    Suppose you have a tensor that has been packed along the first axis (axis=0):

    >>> packed_tensor = torch.tensor([
    >>>     [1, 2, 3, 0, 0],
    >>>     [4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    >>>     [6, 7, 8, 9, 0]
    >>> ])

    Unpacking this tensor would yield:

    >>> unpacked_tensors = unpack(packed_tensor, value=0, axis=0)
    >>> for tensor in unpacked_tensors:
    >>>     print(tensor)
    tensor([1, 2, 3])
    tensor([4, 5])
    tensor([6, 7, 8, 9])
