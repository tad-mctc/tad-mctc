def reshape_fortran(x: Tensor, shape: Size) -> Tensor:
    """
    Implements Fortran's `reshape` function (column-major).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : Tensor
        Input tensor.
    shape : Size
        Output size to which `x` is reshaped.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Reshaped tensor of size `shape`.

def symmetrize(x: Tensor, force: bool = False) -> Tensor:
    """
    Symmetrize a tensor after checking if it is symmetric within a threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : Tensor
        Tensor to check and symmetrize.
    force : bool
        Whether symmetry should be forced. This allows switching between actual
        symmetrizing and only cleaning up numerical noise. Defaults to `False`.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Symmetrized tensor.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the tensor is not symmetric within the threshold.
