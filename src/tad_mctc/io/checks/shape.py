    Check the shapes of the numbers and positions tensors. This explicitly
    checks for non-batched tensor shapes (batched tensors throw errors).

    Parameters
    ----------
    numbers : Tensor
        A 1D tensor containing atomic numbers or symbols.
    positions : Tensor
        A 2D tensor of shape (n_atoms, 3) containing atomic positions.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the shapes are correct.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the shapes of both tensors are inconsistent, the last dimension of
        the positions tensor is not 3 (cartesian directions), the numbers
        tensor has not one dimension, or the positions tensor has not two
        dimensions.
