    Write atomic coordinates in XYZ format to a file object. The input

    Parameters
    ----------
    fileobj : IO[Any]
        The file-like object to which the XYZ data will be written.
    numbers : Tensor
        A 1D tensor containing atomic numbers or symbols.
    positions : Tensor
        A 2D tensor of shape ``(nat, 3)`` containing atomic positions in
        atomic units (bohrs).
    fmt : str, optional
        Format string for the position coordinates.
    comment : str, optional
        A comment string for the XYZ file header.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the comment contains line breaks.
