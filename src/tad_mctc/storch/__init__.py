Safe Operations
===============

This module contains autograd safe versions of common mathematical operations.
These often called "safeops" remove non-differentiable points or restrict
functions to differentiable domains. Most functions aims to retain the syntax
of the underlying PyTorch versions, but some functions are modified or
simplified for more convenience.
