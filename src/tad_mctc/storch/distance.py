def euclidean_dist_quadratic_expansion(x: Tensor, y: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """
    Computation of euclidean distance matrix via quadratic expansion (sum of
    squared differences or L2-norm of differences).

    While this is significantly faster than the "direct expansion" or
    "broadcast" approach, it only works for euclidean (p=2) distances.
    Additionally, it has issues with numerical stability (the diagonal slightly
    deviates from zero for ``x=y``). The numerical stability should not pose
    problems, since we must remove zeros anyway for batched calculations.

    For more information, see \
    `this Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/eth-cscs/PythonHPC/blob/master/\
    numpy/03-euclidean-distance-matrix-numpy.ipynb>`__ or \

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : Tensor
        First tensor.
    y : Tensor
        Second tensor (with same shape as first tensor).

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Pair-wise distance matrix.

        First tensor.
    y : Tensor

    Wrapper for cartesian distance computation.

    This currently replaces the use of ``torch.cdist``, which does not handle
    zeros well and produces nan's in the backward pass.

    Additionally, ``torch.cdist`` does not return zero for distances between
    same vectors (see `here
    <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/57690>`__).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : Tensor
        First tensor.
    y : Tensor | None, optional
        Second tensor. If no second tensor is given (default), the first tensor
        is used as the second tensor, too.
    p : int, optional
        Power used in the distance evaluation (p-norm). Defaults to 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
