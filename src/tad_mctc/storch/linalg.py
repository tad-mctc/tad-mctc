    Estimate maximum and minimum eigenvalue of a matrix using the Gershgorin

    Parameters
    ----------
    amat : Tensor
        A symmetric matrix for which the maximum and minimum eigenvalues are to be estimated.

    Returns
    -------

class SymEigBroadBase(torch.autograd.Function):
    r"""
    Solves standard eigenvalue problems for real symmetric matrices,
    suitable for solving multiple systems with batch processing where
    the first dimension iterates over instances of the batch.

    This function can apply conditional or Lorentzian broadening to the
    eigenvalues during the backwards pass to increase gradient stability.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        A real symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues & eigenvectors will be computed.
    method : {'cond', 'lorn'}, optional
        Broadening method to use. 'cond' refers to conditional broadening,
        'lorn' to Lorentzian broadening. Default is 'cond'.
    factor : Tensor | float, optional
        Degree of broadening (broadening factor). Default is 1E-12.

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
        The eigenvalues, in ascending order.
    v : ndarray
        The eigenvectors.

    Notes
    -----
    Results from backward passes through eigen-decomposition operations
    tend to suffer from numerical stability issues, especially when operating
    on systems with degenerate eigenvalues. Applying eigenvalue broadening
    increases stability but introduces small errors in the gradients. The
    extent of broadening correlates with the stability improvement and the
    error magnitude.

    Two broadening methods are implemented: Conditional broadening as
    described by Seeger [MS2019]_, and Lorentzian as detailed by Liao [LH2019]_.
    The forward pass uses `torch.symeig` to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
    The gradient is calculated as:

    .. math:: \bar{A} = U (\bar{\Lambda} + sym(F \circ (U^t \bar{U}))) U^T

    where :math:`\bar{\Lambda}` is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalue gradients,
    :math:`\circ` denotes the Hadamard product, and `sym` is the symmetrisation
    operator. F is defined as :math:`F_{i, j} = \frac{I_{i \ne j}}{h(\lambda_i - \lambda_j)}`
    with `h` being a function specific to the chosen broadening method.

    Conditional broadening applies only when necessary, limiting gradient errors
    to systems that would otherwise yield NaNs. Lorentzian broadening affects all
    systems regardless of necessity. Without broadening, the backward pass
    resembles a standard eigen-solver.

    direct_inv : bool, optional
        If True then the matrix inversion will be computed
        directly rather than via a call to torch.solve. Only relevant to
        the cholesky scheme. [DEFAULT=False]

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
        The eigenvalues, in ascending order.
    v : ndarray
        The eigenvectors.

    Notes
    -----
    Results from backward passes through eigen-decomposition operations
    tend to suffer from numerical stability issues when operating
    on systems with degenerate eigenvalues. Fortunately, the stability
    of such operations can be increased through the application of eigen
    value broadening. However, such methods will induce small errors in
    the returned gradients as they effectively mutate the eigen-values
    in the backwards pass. Thus, it is important to be aware that while
    increasing the extent of broadening will help to improve stability
    it will also increase the error in the gradients.

    Two different broadening methods have been implemented within this
    class. Conditional broadening as described by Seeger [MS2019]_, and
    Lorentzian as detailed by Liao [LH2019]_. During the forward pass the
    `torch.symeig` function is used to calculate both the eigenvalues &
    the eigenvectors (U & :math:`\lambda` respectively). The gradient
    is then calculated following:

    .. math:: \bar{A} = U (\bar{\Lambda} + sym(F \circ (U^t \bar{U}))) U^T

    Where bar indicates a value's gradient, passed in from the previous
    layer, :math:`\Lambda` is the diagonal matrix associated with the
    :math:`\bar{\lambda}` values, :math:`\circ`  is the so called Hadamard
    product, :math:`sym` is the symmetrisation operator and F is:

    .. math:: F_{i, j} = \frac{I_{i \ne j}}{h(\lambda_i - \lambda_j)}

    Where, for conditional broadening, h is:

    .. math:: h(t) = max(|t|, \epsilon)sgn(t)

    and for, Lorentzian broadening:

    .. math:: h(t) = \frac{t^2 + \epsilon}{t}

    The advantage of conditional broadening is that it is only applied
    when needed, thus the errors induced in the gradients will be
    restricted to systems whose gradients would be nan's otherwise. The
    Lorentzian method, on the other hand, will apply broadening to all
    systems, irrespective of whether or not it is necessary. Note that if
    the h function is a unity operator then this is identical to a
    standard backwards pass through an eigen-solver.

    Mathematical discussions regarding the Cholesky decomposition are
    made with reference to the "Generalized Symmetric Definite
    Eigenproblems" chapter of Lapack. [Lapack]_

    When operating in batch mode the zero valued padding columns and rows
    will result in the generation of "ghost" eigen-values/vectors. These
    are mostly harmless, but make it more difficult to extract the actual
    eigen-values/vectors. This function will move the "ghost" entities to
    the ends of their respective lists, making it easy to clip them out.

    Warnings
    --------
    If operating upon zero-padded packed tensors then degenerate and zero
    valued eigen values will be encountered. This will **always** cause an
    error during the backwards pass unless broadening is enacted.

    As `torch.symeig` sorts its results prior to returning them, it is
    likely that any "ghost" eigen-values/vectors, which result from zero-
    padded packing, will be located in the middle of the returned arrays.
    This makes down-stream processing more challenging. Thus, the sort_out
    option is enabled by default. This results in the "ghost" values being
    moved to the end. **However**, this method identifies any entry with a
    zero-valued eigenvalue and an eigenvector which can be interpreted as
    a column of an identity matrix as a ghost.
